The spatial-ecology of Nassau grouper: Insights from acoustic tracking of this large, long-lived Serranid species across multiple seasons.

Abstract:

Examining home range behavior in reef fish can both elucidate the mechanisms of spatial ecology, and frame spatial resource management
approaches. However, few studies in fishes have examined the spatial nature of home ranges over multiple years. We used a multi-year data 
set of Nassau grouper (Epinephelus striatus) presence/absence and depth data from an acoustic tag tracking network in the Cayman Islands 
to characterize patterns in home range behavior and vertical habitat use. We found that, across multiple years, tagged individuals 
maintained consistent home ranges, although activity centers within those home ranges changed regularly, often after seasonal spawning 
migrations. On a diel scale, individuals were more likely to display increased variability in depth positions (an index of activity) in 
the hours immediately following dawn and preceding dusk. Some individuals with depth-coded acoustic tags shifted to deeper reef areas over 
time. Moreover, we found evidence of a positive relationship between the condition of individuals and depth, suggesting that Nassau 
grouper partition territorial resources along a depth gradient. The finding of persistent home ranges across years suggests that properly 
sized spatial reserves will likely succeed at protecting individuals as they mature and build fecundity.
